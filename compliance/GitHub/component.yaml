        GitHub only allows authorized users to make changes to repos.  GitHub repos are, by default,
        read-only except for the repo owner.  Repos can have teams of people added to them
        (https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository)
        with different access levels 
        (https://help.github.com/en/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization).

        XXX Should document here what policies your org has for managing teams here
