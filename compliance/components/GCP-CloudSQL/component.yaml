        Only GCP authorized Admins, Developers, or App Engine instances are allowed
        to connect to the databases.  No other entities are allowed to connect to
        the databases at all.

        See the [GCP Fedramp Package](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/product/google-services-google-cloud-platform-products-and-underlying-infrastructure?sort=productName&productNameSearch=google)
        for the inherited controls.

        Terraform creates and manages database credentials for the applications, but
        these credentials are effectively just a second (or third) factor for authentication.

        All Cloud SQL events (creation/deletion/update/etc) and the logs generated
        by the database are automatically sent to Stackdriver.  This facility is baked
        into all Cloud SQL instances, with no option to remove or disable.
