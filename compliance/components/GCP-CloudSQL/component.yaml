        Only GCP authorized Admins, Developers, or App Engine instances are allowed
        to connect to the databases.  No other entities are allowed to connect to
        the databases at all.

        See the [GCP Fedramp Package](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/product/google-services-google-cloud-platform-products-and-underlying-infrastructure?sort=productName&productNameSearch=google)
        for the inherited controls.

        Terraform creates and manages database credentials for the applications, but
        these credentials are effectively just a second (or third) factor for authentication.

        All Cloud SQL events (creation/deletion/update/etc) and the logs generated
        by the database are automatically sent to Stackdriver.  This facility is baked
        into all Cloud SQL instances, with no option to remove or disable.

        GCP denies access to all Cloud SQL instances unless it is one of the App Engine apps
        that we have specifically connected it to in the `app.yaml` file used to deploy it.

        GCP Admins and Project Owners can be granted temporary access using an authenticated
        `gcloud beta sql connect` command, which proxies a connection back to the database
        through an encrypted tunnel.
