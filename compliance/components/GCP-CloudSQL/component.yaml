        Only GCP authorized Admins, Developers, or App Engine instances are allowed
        to connect to the databases.  No other entities are allowed to connect to
        the databases at all.

        Terraform creates and manages database credentials for the applications, but
        these credentials are effectively just a second (or third) factor for authentication.

        All Cloud SQL events (creation/deletion/update/etc) and the logs generated
        by the database are automatically sent to Stackdriver.  This facility is baked
        into all Cloud SQL instances, with no option to remove or disable.
