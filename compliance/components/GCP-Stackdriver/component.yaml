        Changes to IAM roles and other IAM events are stored for 400 days in the GCP 
        Stackdriver log system.  Current status can be audited by using the GCP Console
        to look at the IAM roles or by using the "gcloud iam" commandline tool.

        All GCP project activity (App Engine, GCP Console, etc.) is logged to stackdriver,
        and can be viewed using the GCP console or `gcloud logging read` command.

        The GCP Console can be used to access Stackdriver, which allows you to search
        audit logs generated by all GCP components:
        https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/

        Event logs can be continuously watched and alerted on by Stackdriver alerting:
        https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/

        XXX Users of this template process will need to talk about what events they are
        alerting on and how their process for responding works.
