        The CircleCI deployment pipeline for all example apps deployed with this template will
        be automatically scanned by the OWASP ZAP scanner: 
        https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project

        The rails-example app is scanned with an authenticated scan, and the dotnet-example
        and oauth2_proxy apps will be scanned unauthenticated.

        XXX Change this to talk about your application instead of the example apps.

        The CircleCI deployment pipeline for apps and infrastructure is entirely automated,
        and thus the resulting system should always reflect the code and the current best
        DevSecOps practices.  Whenever changes to
        the code are approved and integrated for a particular environment, those changes are
        automatically rolled out.
