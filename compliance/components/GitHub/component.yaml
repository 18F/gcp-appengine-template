        GitHub users are managed with the tools you can find here:
        https://help.github.com/en/categories/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams

        GitHub repos are, by default,
        read-only except for the repo owner.  Repos can have teams of people added to them
        (https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository)
        with different access levels 
        (https://help.github.com/en/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization).

        Users are managed in GitHub according to the policies of the Organization
        they belong to:
        https://help.github.com/en/categories/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams

        Generally, this means that Project Owners will be granted Owner permissions,
        Admins will be granted Admin permissions,
        Developers will be granted Write permissions,
        and everybody else will be read-only, or no access, if the repo is a private repo.

        Whenever Pull Requests are approved for a particular environment, the changes in
        the Pull Requests will be integrated and CircleCI will be notified that it needs
        to automatically deploy the changes, thus ensuring that what is deployed is what is
        in the repo.

        Changes to the application and infrastructure are made through a documented gitops-style workflow.
        These workflows are documented in the README.md file in the repo.

        The quick summary of these workflows is that users will develop locally, but when their
        feature is complete enough to want to integrate, they will submit a Pull Request to the
        "dev" branch, which will notify the GitHub team that changes are available for review.
        The Pull Request must be individually reviewed and approved by another person before it is
        incorporated into the dev branch.  Any time the code is changed, it will trigger an
        automatic deploy of the new code to the proper environment, kick off tests, scan for
        vulnerabilities, etc.
        If it looks good, the user can submit a Pull Request for review to staging and after that,
        production.

        Unapproved Pull Requests can be closed, or the proposed changes can be improved until
        they meet the approval of the reviewers.  No unapproved changes will be integrated
        without approval.

        Infrastructure deploys will also require an authorized CircleCI user to log in to CircleCI
        to review the infrastructure changes that terraform is planning to do.
        If approved, terraform will apply the changes.

        GitHub supports this process by allowing repo owners to turn on Protected Branches
        (https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-protected-branches) so that all changes must
        be reviewed and approved by another person, and by allowing notifications to CircleCI
        so that it will kick off the automated deploy pipeline.  Additionally, status checks
        can be required, allowing for automated code security reviews, etc.

        All changes to the codebase are retained in the git log, and discussions and approval
        records are contained in the GitHub Pull Requests.
