        The users who are authorized to use GCP are added and removed by GSA ICE
        through a process that they are still developing. 

        XXX Should check with GSA ICE
        to see if they have updated their process.

        GCP's Cloud Identity & Access Management (Cloud IAM) lets administrators authorize
        who can take action on specific resources, giving you full control and visibility
        to manage cloud resources centrally.

        The resources that users of GCP can manage, and what types of changes are allowed
        are specified by GSA ICE.

        See the [GCP Fedramp Package](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/product/google-services-google-cloud-platform-products-and-underlying-infrastructure?sort=productName&productNameSearch=google)
        for the inherited controls.

        There are no shared user accounts.

        The users of GCP are required by GSA ICE to use strong 2-factor 
        authentication to log in:  A password and a FIDO/U2F key.

        GCP's Cloud Identity & Access Management (Cloud IAM) lets administrators authorize
        who can take action on specific resources, giving you full control and visibility
        to manage cloud resources centrally.

        The resources that users of GCP can manage are specified by GSA ICE to
        be as restrictive as possible.  Currently that means that the project owner is
        granted the Editor role,
        which does not allow IAM editing, but does allow
        apps/services in the project to be created/managed.  Additional users and roles
        can be added by GSA ICE.

        Eventually, we hope to change this so that Project Owners are given the
        `roles/owner` IAM role, Admins are
        given the `roles/editor` role, Developers may be given `roles/viewer` or
        `roles/editor` roles (or no roles) depending on what they need,
        and Users are not granted GCP accounts/roles.

        Each GCP Project will have it's own set of permissions, so Developers can be
        granted `roles/editor` access in the dev environment to allow for more debugging,
        or they can be granted temporary `roles/viewer` access to production to help
        debug a problem, etc.
