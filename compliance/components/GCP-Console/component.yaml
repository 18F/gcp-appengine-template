        The users who are authorized to use the GCP Console are added and removed by GSA ICE
        through a process that they are still developing.

        The users of the GCP Console are required by GSA ICE to use strong 2-factor 
        authentication to log in:  A password and a FIDO/U2F key.

        GCP's Cloud Identity & Access Management (Cloud IAM) lets administrators authorize
        who can take action on specific resources, giving you full control and visibility
        to manage cloud resources centrally.

        The resources that users of the GCP Console can manage are specified by GSA ICE.

        to manage cloud resources centrally.

        The resources that users of the GCP Console can manage are specified by GSA ICE to
        be as restrictive as possible.  Currently that means that the project owner is
        granted the Editor role 
        (https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#primitive_role_definitions),
        which does not allow IAM editing, but does allow
        apps/services in the project to be created/managed.

        Changes to IAM roles and other IAM events are stored for 400 days in the GCP 
        Stackdriver log system.  Current status can be audited by using the GCP Console
        to look at the IAM roles or by using the "gcloud iam" commandline tool.

        XXX Document policies here on how often you audit the list of users/admins/etc.

        The GCP Console can be used to access Stackdriver, which allows you to search
        audit logs generated by all GCP components:
        https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/

        Event logs can be continuously watched and alerted on by Stackdriver alerting:
