        SSH access to instances is only enabled when you turn on debug mode by an
        GCP authorized Admin, Project Owner, or a Developer who has been granted
        access in the environment.  When ssh access is requested, GCP generates a
        short-lived unique key which is then used by the GCP tools or Console to
        authenticate with the instance.  

        No passwords are used.

        Sudo is required to become root.

        All App Engine events (creation/deletion/update/etc) and the logs generated
        by the apps are automatically sent to Stackdriver.  This facility is baked
        into all GCP App Engine instances, with no option to remove or disable.

        Google automatically updates with the latest security patches and relaunches every
        App Engine instance once a week.

        Every time there is an App Engine deploy, it will build the image with the latest
        runtime that they have certified.
