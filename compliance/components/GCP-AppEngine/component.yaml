        SSH access to instances is only enabled when you turn on debug mode by an
        GCP authorized Admin, Project Owner, or a Developer who has been granted
        access in the environment.  When ssh access is requested, GCP generates a
        short-lived unique key which is then used by the GCP tools or Console to
        authenticate with the instance.  

        No passwords are used.

        Sudo is required to become root.

        All App Engine events (creation/deletion/update/etc) and the logs generated
        by the apps are automatically sent to Stackdriver.  This facility is baked
        into all GCP App Engine instances, with no option to remove or disable.

        Configuration for App Engine apps can be verified by viewing the config for App Engine
        versions/services in the GCP Console, or by using the `gcloud app versions describe`
        command.

        Google automatically hardens it's App Engine images with the latest security
        patches and relaunches every App Engine instance using them once a week.

        In general, changes to running App Engine instances are only allowed when debug
        mode is turned on, and once debug mode is turned off, the instance is deleted
        and relaunched from the base image, so configuration changes on individual instances
        are ephemeral.

        Google automatically updates with the latest security patches and relaunches every

        Every time there is an App Engine deploy, it will build the image with the latest
        runtime that they have certified.

        App Engine is regional, which means the infrastructure is located in a specific region and is managed by Google
        to be redundantly available across all the zones within that region.

        App Engine only allows inbound connections to it's applications through a loadbalancer on port 443/80.
        All other access is denied unless debug mode is enabled, in which case ssh is allowed.

        Connectivity between instances is denied.

        All administrative functions of App Engine are accessed through the Google Cloud SDK,
        which uses https.

        App Engine automatically creates SSL certificates that allow all apps to be accessed
        over https.

        If debug mode is enabled for an instance, the user is allowed to use ssh to access the
        instance.
