        Since the app itself is just an example for how one might deploy an app, there are no
        actual users to manage.  The basic auth is there to ensure that random people cannot get in.

        The rails example app requires basic auth before it will allow users to access the app.
        The credentials for basic auth are shared with people who are authorized to use the app.

        The only exception to this is if the sso_proxy has been deployed in front of it, in which
        case the auth is done by the sso_proxy and requests to the app are verified to be coming
        direct from the proxy by checking the HMAC signature header.
